            <p> Hey! I'm an writer, teacher, engineer, programmer, outdoor and indoor expert.
                Lanuage has been a big part of my life. I've lived in many different countries and what I love about language
                is that it is integrated into everything we do. Programming offers a whole new world of language that improves
                every industry it touches when used correctly. I love learning new languages but I'll admit I have a facination
                with C++!</p>
            <br>
            <p> I hope you enjoy the webpage! Check out the portfolio page!</p>
            <br>
            <p> As Shadowlaq, we are happy to research a variety of topics and share a large variety of skills such as data analysis. 
                Reach out if you'd like to learn more</p>
