            <p> Hey! I'm an writer, language teacher, environmental engineer and caving expert. I'm also an aspiring programmer!
                Lanuage has been a big part of my life. I've lived in many different countries and what I love about language
                is that it is integrated into everything we do. Programming offers a whole new world of language that improves
                every industry it touches when used correctly. I love learning new languages but I'll admit I have a facination
                with C++ probably because C++ was the first programming language I learned when I first got hooked on programming!</p>
            <br>
            <p> I hope you enjoy my webpage! Check out my portfolio page and if you have any questions then please contact me!
                </p>
            <br>
            <p> You're also welcome to contact me about rock questions too! I am a geologist after all! I've know plently of
                places where one could get a special rock! Just name your rock and you've got it! blue rocks...shiny rocks...</p>
